# UTSA Connect: Unifying Campus Life

## Inspiration
The fragmentation of UTSA's digital ecosystem inspired this project. Students often navigate multiple platforms—Blackboard for academics, separate sites for organizations, various social media for events, and distinct messaging apps for communication. **UTSA Connect** seeks to unify these aspects, simplifying student engagement and fostering a connected campus community.

## Features
UTSA Connect provides a centralized platform that:
- Aggregates campus events, club activities, and academic announcements in a single feed.
- Enables real-time messaging among students and organizations.
- Offers a searchable directory of student organizations and academic resources.
- Sends notifications for key updates and deadlines.
- Provides event creation and management tools for student organizations.

## Tech Stack
**Core Technologies**
- **Next.js 13**: Efficient server and client components using the App Router.
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For responsive and flexible design.
- **Lucide React**: Consistent iconography for UI.
- **PropelAuth**: Secure authentication.
- **MongoDB**: Robust database management.

**Architecture Highlights**
- Component-driven, modular development.
- Mobile-first responsive design with Tailwind.
- Server-side rendering for improved load times and performance.
- Hierarchical, modular routing structure for clear navigation.

## Development Challenges
1. **State Management Complexity**: Balancing multiple components with consistent UI state.
   - *Solution*: A well-defined component hierarchy and structured state management.
2. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring a cohesive experience on all device sizes.
   - *Solution*: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS’s responsive classes.
3. **Performance Optimization**: Creating feature-rich UI without sacrificing load times.
   - *Solution*: Server components, lazy loading, and Next.js optimization.
4. **Scalable Navigation**: Designing an intuitive and expandable navigation system.
   - *Solution*: Hierarchical routing with Next.js App Router.

## Accomplishments
- Created a clean, intuitive interface aligned with UTSA’s identity.
- Developed a fully responsive design for seamless multi-device use.
- Built a scalable, modular component architecture for easy feature expansion.
- Achieved fast load times through server-side rendering and lazy loading.
- Established a consistent design language across the application.
